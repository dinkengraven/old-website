					<a href="https://github.com/dinkengraven/breadcrumbs-db">breadCrumbs</a> - (2015, Phase 3 of Dev Bootcamp) - Falling halfway between Geocaching and Snapchat, breadCrumbs allows you to leave notes and photos for friends to find in specific geolocations. Each momento, or breadCrumb, is viewable by the recipient when they arrive at the designated location.  breadCrumbs is an iOS app written in Swift with a backend server built with Ruby on Rails. This was my final group project at Dev Bootcamp. The front-end repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/Salt7900/breadcrumbs">here</a>.

					<a href="http://hey-whats-for-dinner.herokuapp.com/">What's for Dinner?</a> - (2015, Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp) - A recipe app that allows users to create, share, and collect recipes. I was interested in making recipe input as natural as possible while still processing each individual ingredient for the database. I built this over the course of 2 days with Ruby and Sinatra. Repo located <a href="https://github.com/chi-purple-martins-2015/whats-for-dinner">here</a>.

        	<a href="../cheat-sheet.html">Git Cheat Sheet</a> - (2015, Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp) - A quick, handy reference of git commands. I focused on those that I used most often.
        </p>

        	<a href="http://ree-calculator.herokuapp.com">REE Calculator</a> - (2015, Pre-Dev Bootcamp) - My first serious attempt at making a web app with Ruby and Sinatra. Styling via Bootstrap. This app will calculate calorie needs for weight loss and weight maintenance. I built this to speed up some of the more time-consuming calculations that I needed to do as part of my job. I also got to play around with Google Analytics to monitor site traffic.

        <p>I'll continue to add projects to this list in the future.</p>
