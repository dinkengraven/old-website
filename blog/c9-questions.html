         <h4>Asking Questions</h4>
         <h4>September 22, 2015</h4>
         <p>
            In the past couple years of learning to program, I've asked a <em>lot</em> of questions. Sometimes my questions were straightforward and easy to find answers for, others were not. I quickly learned that in order to get my questions answered quickly and thoroughly, I needed to pay attention to how I asked them. 
         </p>
         <p>
            First and foremost, whether you're asking a question to a specific person or to a website, do some research. It's very likely that someone else had a similar problem and it's already been solved. In other words, that old advice "Seek to understand before you seek to be understood" applies even here.
         </p>
         <p>
            When asking a question on a site like Stack Overflow, it's important to have a title that quickly and concisely sums up your question. Not only does this point others with experience in your direction, but it makes it easy for people with similar questions to search for yours. No one wants to answer the same question twice, let alone dozens of times! If you cannot come up with a good title right away, then make this the last step. Sometimes exploring your problem first will help you to sum it up into a workable title.
         </p>
         <p>
            Your title should state exactly what the problem or question entails. Avoid vague titles such as "Question about if statements." Consider instead, "What is the difference between if and if/then statements in Ruby?" Here we have outlined exactly what we want to know, so that anyone scrolling through questions might see ours and say, "Ah! I can answer that!" Assume that you are asking your question to very busy people, and try to make it as easy as possible for them to answer. I have also read that it is best not to lead with the language that you are working in, such as "Ruby: When to use .map! vs .map" instead of something like "When would it be appropriate to use the destructive form of .map in Ruby?" The second title has a more natural cadence, which may be more appealing to potential readers. I'm not sure how important this is, however. Personally if I was on SO to answer questions and my only expertise was in Ruby or Java, then I would want to know right away which language I was dealing with. Although one could also argue that this is why tags are important.
         </p>
         <p>
            Including code in your question is a great way to give instant context. Try to make this short and sweet, without confusing extra details or information that is specific to your employer (they may not want you copying and pasting code just anywhere). Instead, present the problem in clear, easy-to-follow code. It doesn't have to be perfect, just concise. Again, assume that you're dealing with someone who is very busy and only has limited time to answer your question. Even the most patient and helpful guide won't want to dig through your post to find meaning. To go a step further, you could include a link to a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a> or similar interactive resource. This makes it easy for others to quickly access your code and work with it to give you your answer. It's still a good idea to include code in the question post itself however, as links can break over time.
         </p>
         <p>
            Consider what other information might be useful. Which version of the language are you using? Which operating system? Are you using any other software that may depend on your code? Do you have any constraints? For example, in certain exercises during Dev Bootcamp Phase 0, we were not allowed to use recursion or regular expressions to solve a problem. Be sure to include this type of information in your post, as it would be incredibly vexing for someone to take the time to answer your question only to be told that their answer is invalid based on what you are or are not allowed to do. If some or all of this information is irrelevant to your question, then simply exclude it. But before you make your post, ask yourself, "If I was going to answer this question, what would I need to know?"
         </p>
         <p>
            Use proper grammar, check your spelling, and proofread your code. People are probably going to pay more attention to a thoughtfully-worded, well-written question than a few sentence fragments with multiple misspelled words. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Finally -- and this may seem obvious but we do live in the age of YouTube comments -- be kind, be polite, and thank those who take the time to help you. If someone takes the time to answer your question, take a moment to say thanks. If you disagree with the answer and want to discuss it, do so respectfully. If you simply don't understand, ask for clarification. But first try your best to make sense of the answer, and look up the parts you don't recognize immediately. Not only will this help you to remember those things, but you don't demand further time from someone else to explain something that could be easily looked up.
         </p>
         <p>
            Asking questions can be one of the best ways to learn. It requires critical thinking, assessment and analysis of a problem, and stepping out of your comfort zone -- all important skills to furthering your own education. Throughout all of my time in school and at various jobs, I always found it better to ask questions when I was stuck than to simply try to power through (which may waste time in the long run). One powerful piece of advice that I received from a DBC alum was to set a time limit when you're stuck. Try to figure it out, but if you hit your time limit and still don't know the answer -- ask for help. This is something that will be challenging for me, but definitely the best choice in the long run!
